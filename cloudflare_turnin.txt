- Had issue getting MPC started just slowed down the inital starting phase when trying to integrate cloudflare services using AI tools. Using cursor specifically (mention not as good documentation and ended up looking through youtube and reddit and github comments)
- MCP vectorize didnt exist in worker bindings server for some reason, which i felt was inconsistent with the titling since you can find it in bindings page.
- Once getting the cloudflare worker bindings connected it took a minute to get the actual API responding back from our database queries on D1 but after that i had no large issues in trying to fetch data it worked very smoothly past that point and was easy to configure as needed!
- Some disconnect on my behalf with .env.production api i set it to a different url as i originally had a worker and pages backend + frontend setup and it was mis-set but after recognizing this i quickly altered it and had all worker api functioanliy workign with my D1.
- Asset not found. Make sure to run the frontend dev server (npm run dev) separately. (Env: AI, ATTACHMENTS, CACHE, DB, VECTORIZE), found out this was an issue with the configuration needing expliciting binding for "ASSETS"
